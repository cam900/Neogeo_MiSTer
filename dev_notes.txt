The code running on the ARM CPU (HPS) loads the requested core as
an .rbf file via fpga_load_rbf in fpga_io.cpp in Main_MiSTer

In the menu, the FPGA core acts like a graphics card for the linux
system (which is only able to display a menu-style interface)

In each core, the stuff in /sys/ provides the video scaling, video
and audio output, and HPS interface logic.
The hps_io module "breaks out" a bunch of signals for the core to
utilize.

The core itself must take care of giving access
to the SDRAM controller for the HPS, and then switch to run mode
to read the data.
